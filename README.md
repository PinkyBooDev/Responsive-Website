# Responsive-Website

This is a small project that tries to imitate the responsive design of a real company website: Batatabit. I developed all the accessibility resources and managed correctly the images and displays of containers for better lecture and easy overflow. This time I didn't use any framework, so every style is pure CSS.

Project based on the Platzi platform course.
